# PresideNotify
PresideNotify is of tools for monitoring email Inboxes and/or folders and sending notifications to the Preside iPhone app when new emails arrive.


# Prerequisites
Before using these monitoring tools, you should go to the More > Syncing screen in Preside and set the 'Background Sync' type to "Remote (private computer)". That should lead you through a process whereby you register for a Preside.io account if you don't already have one. You should also enable the 'New email notification' option on that same 'Syncing & Notifications' screen. That should obtain permission from iOS to issue notifications. 

To check to make sure you have everything setup properly, open the terminal app or other shell and issue a 'curl' command like:

curl
